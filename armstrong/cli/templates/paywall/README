This template shows a working version of paywall code. The paywall is declared
in urls/defaults.py. By default, the SubscriptionPaywall returns a 304 when
access is denied, but it has been overriden to render the
permission_denied.html template instead. The only view that needs to be
protected is the ArticleDetailView.

The third article on the front page, 'Help Wanted' is protected. When not
logged in, the permission_denied.html will be rendered, but when logged in as a
staff member or as the user with the username 'user' and password of 'user' you
will see the normal article.html template.
